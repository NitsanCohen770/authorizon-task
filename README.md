## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Login with email and password using the Auth0 service.
- See all messages of other users in realtime.
- Admin users should be able to filter messages by choosing a filter.
- If a message if filtered, it is only visible to the Admin user.

## My process

First I built the front-end part

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

It was very nice to get familiar with the Auth0 service. Integrating it to the app was a breeze thanks to the great official docs they have.

### Continued development

I would like to upgrade the app the serverless using AWS services and Next.js

### Useful resources

- [Auth0 offical docs](https://auth0.com/docs/) - This helped me for integrating the Auth0 in the React app. I really liked the straight forward tutorials with explained examples.
